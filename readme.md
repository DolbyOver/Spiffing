# Spiffing CSS

Why, hello, dear visitor! If you're the kind of person predisposed to converse about the weather over a round of tea and crumpets, then you'll appreciate Spiffing: a CSS preprocessor with only one job â€” to correct the spelling errors prevalent in the language.

## Requirements:
PHP 5.2+, well-spelt CSS.

## To install:
1. Download Spiffing (it's the ZIP button up there), and upload to your server.
2. Prepend all references to your CSS with "spiffing.php?file=" (changing the paths and values where necessary).
3. Twirl your moustache in typically-British subdued delight.

## Problems?
Just send me a message on Twitter. I'm @idiot.
